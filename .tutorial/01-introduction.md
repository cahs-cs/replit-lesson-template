# Introduction

Welcome back to repl.it for some review!

This short set of lessons will help you remember what we covered in **unit 1** (or give you the oppurtunity to learn it for the first time)

My intent is for you to spend **20-30 minutes on each lesson**. This may vary depending on how much attention you paid throughout this class.

Try to watch the videos included to get a better idea of what to do.
