# Background Information

This is a very basic introduction to python and repl.it, at this point I won't assume you know much.

By the end of the lesson you should be able to do the following:

1. Navigate repl.it to see the tutorial
2. Navigate repl.it to run test cases
3. Navigate repl.it to access the correct file
4. Write a print statement to display something on the console.
