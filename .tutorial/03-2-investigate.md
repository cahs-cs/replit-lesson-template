# Investigate

You should freely modify the starting code to investigate the following prompts. If you can no longer fix the code at any point, copy it from below:

```py
print("Hello World!")
```

## Prompt 1

What happens when you don't include quotes?

Consider the following examples, and what they print.

```py
print(hello world!)
```

```py
print(123)
```

```py
print("123")
```

```py
print("Hello World!)
```

## Prompt 2

What happens if you have multiple lines of code?

Consider the following examples, and what they print.

```py
print("hello")
print("world")
```

```py
